## TODO

- [X] Clean up unneeded Lua convertor code
- [ ] Add command options such as converting in place
- [ ] Add configuration options to change default behaviour
  - [ ] Convert file inplace rather than creating a new one
  - [ ] Open file in browser once converted
- [ ] Write some great documentation so users can learn about my plugin with `:help`
- [ ] Write some tests (because apparently those are important)
- [ ] The current parser is a little too simple, try rewriting the showdown.js Markdown to HTML parser in Lua it's around 500 lines of code
